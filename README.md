# QuickACCESS / OnBright Assistance Software
This was my project at Eyetech Digital Systems. It is a tool that allows users to do mouse actions with their eyes using the Eytech Eyetracker. The user is able to move the cursor, click, double click, right click, and a multidude of other actions and tools are available.

# Random Name Generators
My latest personal project that is still being actively developed. The goal is to provide a large variety of name generators for a broad list of subjects. From everyday names, to fantasy and sci-fi names (still working on those!).

# Dofus Retro Material Builder
I made this Electron based app to solve a common problem in the online multiplayer game Dofus. Equipment in the game requires you gather a large list of materials. For an entire set of equipment, it can be cumbersome to gather a list of all the ingredients. Retro Material Builder fixes this issue by automatically creating a list of materials based on the equipment you select.

# Discord Writer Bot
This project was created for a Discord server for an author. I created a bot for the server, with a list of useful commands that are all listed out on the Discord owner's website.

# Pokemon Battle Simulator
One of my earlier projects I made during my learning. A Pokémon battle simulator that allows the player to choose a character, and interact with the battle by choosing to attack, change Pokémon, or run.

# Rock Paper Scissors 
My first attempt at creating a realtime application using Firebase. This is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors, but completely playable online by 2 players.
